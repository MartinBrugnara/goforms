 * Remove Form.Data, and instead provide to Form.IsValid()
 * Perhaps make Form.CleanedData and Form.Errors private, providing getters?
 * Add defaults to fields so that a value is always included, or even remove Required, assuming that a field is required if there's no default?.
 * Enable custom error messages.
 * Update field tests to use nicer in/out for test tables like form_tests.
